			<span>* The rendering engine used by 2charts.com leverages intelligent algorithms to interpret tabular data on the internet and derive appropriate charts from that data. </span>
			<span>Although this engine makes its best effort to correctly "parse" the table data, there is no guarantee that it will get the results that you expect. </span>
			<span>The challenge is the vast variety of more or less exotic tables out on the web. </span>
			<span>We will constantly improve those algorithms in order to increase 2charts.com's successful rendering ratio. </span>
